Who I am? 
A developer looking to reach his full potential within the IT world. I really enjoy teamwork, collaborating with others, learning, teaching (to the best of my ability) and I always try to go one step further. Curious, restless, lover of challenges and continuous knowledge and growth. 

What is my experience? 
I did Henry's Bootcamp, in which I learned and consolidated a stack of technologies such as: Javascript, Node, React & Redux, React Native, PostgreSQL. I carried out an individual project that consisted of the development of a Single Page Application that consumes data from an external API and a local database applying the aforementioned technologies. 
Regarding the final work, I was part of a large working group to carry out an E-Commerce for a craft beer manufacturer in my province. The project was carried out using the MERN Stack and under the Scrum modality. 


Things that I like? Spending time with my family and friends, literature and cinema, learning a little of everything: art, science, history, philosophy. Animals are my weakness, my ground wire, I really enjoy their company and their presence. 

If you are interested in my profile, do not hesitate to contact me! 

I leave you a big greeting and have a nice day. 😊
